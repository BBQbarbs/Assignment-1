									<h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
																	</header>
									<p> <a href="Position Description.PDF">Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Risk Analyst Consultant [PDF]</a></p>
									<p><i>(Note: It was tricky to find my absolute ideal job, which I think probably has a lot to do with COVID-19 and a lack of job advertisements, but also probably that what I have in mind – a geopolitical risk GIS analyst – is rather specific. In any case, the position I did find requires many of the same skills, knowledge and experience, so it will suffice for the purposes of assignment 1).</i></p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="10703656_615572065230384_1795978980673689938_n_615572065230384.jpg" alt="Palawan airport" /></div>
								<h4>Position description and what makes it appealing to me:</h4>
<p>The position sits within the Emergency Preparedness and Response Coordination Branch of the World Food Program (WFP), which, as the name suggests, is responsible for enhancing the anticipatory and response capacity of the WFP in times of crisis. The GIS Risk Analyst role primarily manages georeferenced data to analyse multivariate hazards and identify risks. The main reason that the position is being advertised is that the WFP wants to develop a Spatial Contextual Risk Analysis Model (SCRAM). This SCRAM will combine a number of data layers – such as population vulnerability and hazard exposure – in order to better model the probabilities of humanitarian crises, and to classify sub-national areas according to their level of exposure. It is anticipated that this will support WFP decision-making, improve emergency preparedness, and ultimately save lives.
</p><p>
The reason this job appeals to me is that it combines the knowledge that I already possess from my previous experience with the skillset I will acquire during my time at RMIT – namely, International Relations and Information Technology (or, more specifically, Geospatial Science). It has the added benefit of being an impactful role, insofar as it is humanitarian, which is important for me in a career satisfaction sense.
</p>
<br>
<h4>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position</h4>
<p>
The role requires the following skills, experience and qualifications:
<li>A GIS degree and experience working in an international scientific environment</li>
<li>At least half-a-decade of experience in GIS risk analysis, including advanced development skills with ArcPy (mandatory)</li>
<li>Advanced risk analysis and GIS spatial analysis skills</li>
<li>Familiarity with spatial databases, and experience editing vectors</li>
<li>Proficiency in the main GIS/Remote Sensing software: ERDAS, ENVI ArcGIS 10</li>
</p>
<br>
<h4>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h4>
<p>
My tertiary qualifications and work experience are not so much relevant in a direct sense, but my understanding of International Relations more broadly, and geopolitics in particular, equip me with some useful background knowledge and conceptual awareness of the objectives and function of the World Food Program. Critical and analytical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication are likewise all attributes that I have developed over the years, through both education and work experience, that would also be complementary to my application.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, I do not yet possess any of the technical GIS skills or scientific experience specifically required by the role.
</p>
<br>
<h4>How I plan to obtain the necesarry skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those I have now </h4>
<p>
Obviously, completing the Undergraduate Certificate in Information Technology, and then a Master’s of Geospatial Science, will be the first step I take to acquire the technical know-how laid out in the advertisement. During my studies, I will also look to undertake some type of work experience or internship which will allow me to get a feel for how the things I learn are applied in a professional setting.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the specific software requirements (ERDAS, ENVI ArcGIS 10), those that are not taught at RMIT I will learn in my own time, either through at-home learning, or possibly through some type of short course. Ideally, I will be able to find an internship or placement that uses some or all of these programs.
</p>
<p>
Given the five-year experience requirement, I will have plenty of time to cumulatively build up the skillset needed from other roles. For example, I could get a job that is purely in GIS spatial analysis, then move into one that encompasses more risk analysis elements, then focus on spatial database management, etc. During this phase I would also ensure that I gained demonstrable experience working in an international scientific environment by, for example, attending conferences and building up my network.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, each progressive step in my career should be made with my ideal job in mind, and tailored to how it can help me develop the skills to enable me to get the job. At the same time, I will be open-minded to career paths I had not considered.
