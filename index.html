	<h3><b>Interest in IT</b></h3>
	<br>
<p>
	My interest in IT is not so much any passion for IT per se, but more an appreciation of the career pathways that it can open up for me. I have degrees and work experience in a different field (International Relations), but for reasons of industry competitiveness I have been unable to secure a full-time job. COVID-19 has not helped in that regard either, particularly because the jobs I did have were casual and at universities – a sector which will be adversely affected for a number of years as I am sure you would appreciate. But this has also afforded me the opportunity to re-evaluate my career path, and, having a long-held fascination with maps and geography, I have decided to study a Master’s of Geospatial Science in 2021 (this will also complement the knowledge and skillset I already have). In that context, RMIT’s six-month certificate in IT stood out as a great way for me to get familiar with many of the concepts that I will need to grasp moving forward particularly as my IT experience is quite limited.
</p>
<p>
	I chose to come to RMIT because one of my good friends studied a Master of Data Science here, and he spoke highly of the practical and industry-focused aspects of his course. I know that the Master of Geospatial Sciences takes a similar approach in that regard, which is quite appealing. Likewise, the long history of geospatial science at RMIT means that not only is there a wealth of broad experience to draw upon from the academics, but also the opportunity to tap into industry connections throughout the course of my studies. When on-campus learning recommences, RMIT’s location is also a drawcard, as I live relatively close by. But the main reasons that I chose RMIT relate to its reputation as an industry-focused institution where students graduate job-ready.
</p>
<p>
	I expect that the undergraduate certificate in IT will give me a broad, foundational knowledge platform on which my later studies will build upon in a more focused way. I would not be so naïve to think that I will be an IT expert after six months, but from prior studies I know that what I learn will nevertheless be invaluable. My prior tertiary education experiences were quite different, being in the Social Sciences as they were, so I am excited to learn new skills in new ways.
