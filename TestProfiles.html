								<p>According to the tests I took, I have the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits, am a visual learner, and have a very typical level of creativity. My strengths include analytical thinking, open-mindedness and objectivity; whereas my weaknesses include absent-mindedness, insularity and second-guessing myself. Interestingly, my Myers-Briggs results – which suggest creativity and originality – somewhat clash with my creativity results, which are scored almost exactly the same as the average.</p>

								<p>In terms of influencing my behaviour, I think I would need to focus on listening to other team members and valuing their input as equal to mine. This could include taking notes during or after conversations with them to help visualise their input. Equally, I would need to make sure that I voice my own thoughts clearly and confidently when appropriate. I should adequately prepare beforehand, and critique my own ideas, in order to ensure I speak with confidence and make a valuable contribution.</p>

								<p>To implement these insights when forming a team, I should seek out at least one person who is more of an extrovert, who might be able to better get conversations started and keep them running along. In any case, I would seek to collaborate with others who have would appear to have different combinations of traits to myself, as I value the role that diversity can play. That said, I am pretty easy going and would be able to work professionally with anyone I am teamed up with.</p>
