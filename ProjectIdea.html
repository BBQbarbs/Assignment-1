									<h1>My Project Idea</h1>
									<p>My project idea is for a car windscreen with the inbuilt augmented reality technology to have a satellite navigation system overlay superimposed over it as a heads-up display. The whole windscreen will act as the display for the navigation system, which will be minimalist so as not to prevent the driver from seeing real world obstacles. The end product will allow the driver to actually ‘see’ the directions that they need to go, rather than a representation of it. </p>

								<h4>Motivation</h4>
								<p>Navigation apps are ubiquitous. According to a 2018 survey by <a href="https://themanifest.com/mobile-apps/popularity-google-maps-trends-navigation-apps-2018"><i>The Manifest</i></a>, 77% of smartphone owners regularly use navigation apps. Of that number, 87% use navigation apps primarily while driving. An issue with smartphone navigation apps, however, is that the phone must be mounted on or near the dashboard of the car to be useful. Even when mounted, the driver must look away from the road momentarily if they want to check the geographic representation of where they are going (in some cases the audio instructions are alone insufficient for this purpose).
								</p>
								<p>
									If the directions were superimposed directly onto the inside of the windshield (in a minimalist and non-obstructionist way), this would eliminate the momentary distraction of looking at a phone screen. Finally, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/business/car-navigation-systems-apps.html">this <i> New York Times </i> article</a>, car manufacturers are looking at ways to become more competitive in the SatNav space - an area which smartphone apps like Google Maps and Waze currently dominate. This product could thus offer them that chance (and also attract their investment).
								</p>
								<br>
								<h4>Features</h4>
								<p>
								The central feature would be a clear display that has the structural strength and integrity required of a windshield. Another option would be a thinner display that could be inlaid on the interior of the windshield. In the former case, the product could be included with the purchase of a car (a deal could be struck with manufacturers, such as Tesla for example); in the latter, it could be sold as an add-on feature for an existing car. Such ‘smart glass’ technology <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/article/11347/new-smart-glass-tech-turns-car-windows-into-video-screens">already exists</a>, and with further refinement could be adapted to suit the exact needs of this project.

<br>
<br>
<p>
In terms of user interface, there would be a strict minimalist design for what will be displayed on the windshield, for example an overlay of an unobtrusive line depicting the directions to the destination that does not distract the driver or obstruct their view from what is happening around them.
</p>
<p>
	The technology would rely heavily on voice recognition and activation technology, so that the driver would be able to ask the display to turn on or off, or dim the brightness, as well as ask for new directions, without having to physically touch anything or be distracted. This feature is not unlike current siri technology.
</p>
<p>
The product would require that the car had a GPS device and a set of external cameras in order to determine the location of the vehicle, and which direction it was facing, so that the directions projected onto the display were accurate. In this sense, it would be a great product to develop in conjunction with an autonomous vehicle manufacturer, given that these vehicles would already be equipped with these things. While satellite navigation would not be required to direct the driver in this case, it would still provide useful visual cues and information to the passenger about where they were headed. The voice activated directions could also allow them to alter their course.
</p>
<p>
There would also be the option to connect the vehicle’s operational data with the system so that things like engine warning lights or the speedometer could also be projected onto the display. This could conceivably, over time, allow for dashboards to be reduced in size and replaced by a larger windshield. This would increase visibility and contribute to the vehicle occupant’s spatial awareness – further enhancing safety.
</p>
<p>
The system could also be programmed to monitor the speed of surrounding vehicles, and, depending on cost, could be programmed to display speeds and warnings for other vehicles on the road. This feature could be rolled out as a premium feature to begin with depending on cost.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Tools & Technologies Required</h4>
<p>
	A key requirement for the technology would be the navigation software. This could be sourced from a third party, such as Google Maps, or developed in house. The former is probably preferred, as it would open opportunities for investment from companies looking to extend the application of their navigation product, while also allowing the windshield producer to focus purely on designing and creating the heads-up display (HUD), rather than also having to develop a comprehensive satellite navigation software infrastructure.
	<p>
		<p>
The augmented reality HUD would require some cutting-edge technological prowess. Limited field-of-view HUDs are slowly coming online in the marketplace, but they are niche and expensive. Moreover, a fully functional augmented reality HUD is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/augmented-reality-heads-up-displays-for-cars-are-finally-a-real-thing/">yet to be commercially implemented</a>. This would no doubt present a technological challenge. The optical projection systems element would probably present the most challenging aspect, given that the augmented reality HUDs are a cutting edge tehnology. Other technological requirements, such as voice recognition and command technology and the actual satellite navigation software, are more readily available with established best practices and precedent.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Skills Required</h4>
		<p>
The hardware (transparent OLED display, vehicle cameras, GPS, etc.) is all available commercially, although bringing it all together as a coherent product would require a team of highly skilled programmers and engineers. Given that windshield displays have been on the horizon for a few years now, it stands to reason that a large investment and significant effort would be required to get finally this idea off the ground and commercially viable. But, if such investment was sourced – particularly if it were from large companies like Google and Tesla who already have the technology that could be leveraged in the project (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/08/26/are-you-ready-for-augmented-reality-in-your-car/#41c501e13144">and who have demonstrated a keen interest in the augmented reality space</a>) – then a team could be put together with the requisite skills to make the project a reality.
		</p>
		<p>
		The hardware would present the biggest challenge, hence the necessity of recruiting skilled engineers with a specialisation in optical projection systems. In terms of software, the augmented reality operating system would need to be written for the heads-up display in a way that would incorporate and understand the data being recorded by the cameras and voice command systems. As stated previously, however, things like the satellite navigation and voice recognition software could be sourced from a third party so as to allow for a focus on fine-tuning the windshield screen technology along with the HUD software.
	</p>
<br>
<h4>Projected Outcomes</h4>


<li>Enhanced safety due to drivers not having to be momentarily distracted by looking at their phone screen in order to visualise the directions that are being given to them.</li>
<li>An improvement on space utilisation in vehicles – i.e. if much of what is contained in chunky dashboards can be instead superimposed onto the windshield, then this could minimise space requirements for things like physical speedometers and clocks. Not only would this be aesthetically pleasing; it would also contribute to safety by reducing clutter and increasing visibility through the increase in windshield size.</li>
